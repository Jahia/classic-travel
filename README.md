# classic-travel

> **This repository has moved.** classic-travel is now developed in the
> [classic-templates monorepo](https://github.com/Jahia/classic-templates), under
> [`packages/travel`](https://github.com/Jahia/classic-templates/tree/main/packages/travel), and
> released together with the template set. This repository is archived; its history continues
> there, and the [0.1.0 release](https://github.com/Jahia/classic-travel/releases/tag/0_1_0) stays
> available here.

Travel content for Jahia sites built on the [classic-templates](https://github.com/Jahia/classic-templates)
template set: destinations and fare offers with their own pages, automatic fare and destination
lists, and a travel tools section shown as tabs. Built for travel and airline demonstration sites;
every text and link is contributed content, in every site language.

The module has no page template: its content renders inside classic-templates pages and follows the
site's classic-templates theme (light and dark) through its design tokens.

## Requirements

- Jahia 8.2.1 or later with `javascript-modules-engine` 1.2 or later.
- **classic-templates** 0.2.0 or later, installed and used by the site (declared module
  dependency): the travel types reuse its mixins, page areas, tabs, content list and design tokens
  (0.2.0 brings the emphasis colour used for prices and the tabs the sections can sit in).

## Installation

Download `classic-travel-<version>.tgz` from the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/Jahia/classic-travel/releases) and install it in Jahia
(Administration > Modules), or build it with `yarn build && yarn package`. Then enable
**classic-travel** on a site that uses the classic-templates template set (Site settings >
Modules, or the provisioning API: `- enable: "classic-travel"` with `site: "<siteKey>"`).

## Content types

| Type                                      | What it is                                                                                                                                    | Where it goes                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Destination (`ctrv:destination`)          | A city served: airport code, country, region, teaser, description, image, "from" price and its note, key facts, related destinations          | A content folder. Own page; cards in destination grids and content lists |
| Fare offer (`ctrv:fareOffer`)             | A fare to one destination: departure city, cabin, price, travel period, end of sale, conditions, call to action                               | A content folder. Own page; cards in fare lists and content lists        |
| Fare list (`ctrv:fareList`)               | A section listing fare offers under a folder, by region of the destination, sorted by price, end of sale or destination; ended sales left out | Page areas, columns and free zones of classic-templates pages            |
| Destination grid (`ctrv:destinationGrid`) | A section listing destinations under a folder, by region, from A to Z, with their "from" price                                                | Page areas, columns and free zones                                       |
| Travel tools (`ctrv:travelTools`)         | A section of tools (book, manage, check in), each a tab with its text and link, and a notice shown to every visitor                           | Page areas, columns and free zones                                       |

Destinations and fare offers are also listable by the classic-templates **Content list**
(`ctpl:jcrQuery`: pick "Destination" or "Fare offer" as the content to list), in cards or as a
compact list. Tags and categories are the platform's own, available on every item.

Every field has an English and a French label and tooltip in the content editor.

## Editor usage

1. Create a content folder (for example `Travel`) and add destinations to it, then a sub-folder
   (`Fares`) with fare offers. Pick each offer's destination: cards show its city and image, and
   fare lists filter on its region.
2. On a page, add a **Fare list** and point **Look under** at the fares folder; choose the region
   and the order. Add a **Destination grid** the same way.
3. Add a **Travel tools** section, write its notice (for a demonstration site: "This is a
   demonstration site: no booking is made"), and add one tool per tab, each with its button.
4. Publish the folders and the page. Publishing content does not publish the images it uses:
   publish the image folder too.

Links (buttons) are set per language: a link set in English only has no target in French, and
edit mode says so. A fare offer whose sale has ended leaves the fare lists the next day, and its
page says the sale has ended; edit mode shows how many offers each list leaves out and why.

## Accessibility and SEO

- One `<h1>` per page: the city or the offer name on its own page (the page template of
  classic-templates renders the rest of the page). Sections start at `h2`, one level lower inside a
  titled column row, a tab (under its label) or a titled free zone, nested containers included;
  card headings follow their list.
- Prices read well aloud: "From HKD 1,280" for the eye, "From 1,280 Hong Kong dollars" for screen
  readers. Dates are written in the page's language.
- Cards are whole-card links named by the city, with the cabin and departure city added for screen
  readers; images on cards are decorative.
- Travel tools are WAI-ARIA tabs (arrow keys, Home, End) built from stacked sections, which remain
  as they are without JavaScript and in edit mode.
- Rich text is sanitised at render time with the classic-templates allow-list (headings renumbered
  under the section heading, tables in a focusable scroll region).
- Destination and offer pages carry schema.org JSON-LD (`TouristDestination`, `Offer`), linked to the
  page graph written by classic-templates.
- Checked with axe (all rules) in light and dark schemes, EN and FR, and at 320 px wide.

## Theming

The views read the classic-templates semantic tokens only (`--ctpl-color-*`, `--ctpl-font-*`,
`--ctpl-space-*`...), so they follow every theme and colour scheme chosen in the site settings.
Prices use the theme's highlight colour, `--ctpl-color-highlight`, and fall back to the accent
colour with versions of classic-templates that do not define it.

## Development

Node 22 and Yarn 4 (Corepack). Run every command from the module root.

```bash
yarn install
yarn build && yarn deploy     # build the package and install it in the local Jahia (http://localhost:8080)
yarn lint                     # ESLint
yarn test                     # Vitest unit tests (formatting, selection, queries, sanitizer, JSON-LD)
yarn check:tokens             # no literal colour or primitive token in the stylesheets
python3 scripts/seed-test-site.py   # test site "ctrv-test" with EN and FR travel content
```

`yarn deploy` reads `JAHIA_HOST` and `JAHIA_USER` from `.env` (defaults `http://localhost:8080` and
`root:root1234`). The CND files are checked with the AIStartupKit `check-cnd.mjs`. AI agents start
with [`.agents/README.md`](.agents/README.md).
